# Navbar
Header navigations are simpler navigation menus that help the user navigate through an application. Generally, these are better for simpler applications with less menu options to choose from. Header navigations should be as helpful as possible, with clear and accessible links to everywhere the user may need to go without being cluttered/overwhelming.

<Primary />
<Controls />

## Examples

<div className="story-layout-ex">
  <div className="story-layout-ex--section">
    <div className="story-card-ex">
      There are 3 types of appearances here:
      - default 
      - inverse
      - subtle 

      By changing the `appearance` prop you can use different styles of the navbar.
      `appearance` supports a default value (default).

      <Canvas of={NavbarStories.Default} />
      <Canvas of={NavbarStories.Inverse} />
      <Canvas of={NavbarStories.Subtle} /> 
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
